"""
This script is used to track the changes between two commits in a repository.
It should return the following information:
- Any renames happened in the commit
- The line number offsets of the old file to the new file (used to get the corresponding line number of the new file from the old file)
- The new file changes (line ranges that were added/modified)

The line number offsets can be used to get the line number of the new file from the old file by subtracting the offset from the line number of the old file.
- line_number_new = line_number_old - offset

The new file changes can be filtered out the violations that are from the changed code which should always be considered as new violations.
